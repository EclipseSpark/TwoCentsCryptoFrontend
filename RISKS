TWO CENTS CRYPTO FRONTEND 
Security risks

Read carefully this document. Here are reported many security issues that may
happen using TCCF.
TCCF is designed to make simple many encryption taks but some of them are not
secure to be used in multiuser environments or systems where you haven't the 
full control.

* Shor Message encryption utilities
  Passphrases are passed in clear as a parameter of GPG, so this may be a
  problem on multiuser systems.
  Use it only on systems where you are the only user.

* GPG Encrypted Text File Edit
  -To perform the clear file edit, the script needs to pass the passphrase
   once as command parameter.
   This way the passphrase is visible in the top(1) screen or in the ps(1) 
   output.
   If someone can access to these commands on the system, then can steal
   your password!
  -To edit the file, in the same directory of the encrypted file, a clear
   text temporary file is created with the name 
   [name of the encrypted file].temp.wawa
   This file will be securely removed after edit task ends but until then
   root can access to this file anytime!

* GPG Symetric Directory Decryption
  Decrypt all the files of a directory with gpg automatically. To accomplish
  this taks, the program needs to pass the passphrase as a parameter.
  This way the passphrase is visible in the top(1) screen or in the ps(1) 
  output.
  If someone can access to these commands on the system, then can steal
  your password!

* Temporary files
  Many scripts of TCCF uses text clear temporary files. For 90% of the tasks
  these files only contains menu choices or other informations not related
  to the content.
  These files are stored mainly in /tmp directory. Remember that having /tmp
  encrypted is always a safe choice.
